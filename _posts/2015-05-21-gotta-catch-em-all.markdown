I was fascinated with the idea of creating websites from my school days. I was taught HTML as part of my 7th grade curriculum which fuelled this desire further. To know that a piece of code written by me was hosted publicly on the internet felt like a big deal to me at that time. I still remember the countless free webhosting services evaluated by me. It was very difficult to find a service that allowed deployment of static HTML files <sup id="fn-1">[1](#fn-res-1)</sup> and I ended up chosing *geocities* because it allowed me to create files and directories through their interface <sup id="fn-2">[2](#fn-res-2)</sup>. I was addicted to Pokemon at that time, so my first website contained their theme songs, links to download GBA roms of Red, Blue, Ruby and Sapphire and wallpapers <sup id="fn-3">[3](#fn-res-3)</sup>. I think that website must have gotten a grand total of 3-4 hits from my school friends, but the fact that I still remember this might suggest that it meant a lot to me then. 

###### Footnotes
<sup id="fn-res-1">[1](#fn-1)</sup> This was when providers like *tucows*,*bravehost* and *geocities* reigned supreme<br/>
<sup id="fn-res-2">[2](#fn-2)</sup> I would learn about VCS and deployment much later during college<br/>
<sup id="fn-res-3">[3](#fn-3)</sup> This website was a casualty of the death of geocities.com ..sniff..
